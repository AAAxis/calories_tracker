# Delete Dialog Translation Fixes

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Delete dialogs not translated

### Problems Identified:
1. **Dashboard meal delete dialog** - All text was hardcoded in English
2. **Ingredient delete dialog** - All text was hardcoded in English  
3. **Snackbar messages** - Delete progress and result messages were in English
4. **Swipe action text** - "Delete" text in swipe background was hardcoded

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:

#### 1. Dashboard Delete Dialog
**Before**: 
- "Delete Meal" (hardcoded)
- "Are you sure you want to delete this meal?" (hardcoded)
- "This action cannot be undone." (hardcoded)
- "Cancel" / "Delete" buttons (hardcoded)

**After**:
- Uses `dashboard.delete_meal`.tr()
- Uses `dashboard.delete_meal_question`.tr()
- Uses `dashboard.delete_cannot_be_undone`.tr()
- Uses `dashboard.cancel`.tr() / `dashboard.delete`.tr()

#### 2. Ingredient Delete Dialog  
**Before**:
- "Remove Ingredient" (hardcoded)
- "Are you sure you want to remove..." (hardcoded)
- "Cancel" / "Remove" buttons (hardcoded)

**After**:
- Uses `item_detail.remove_ingredient`.tr()
- Uses `item_detail.remove_ingredient_question`.tr()
- Uses `item_detail.cancel`.tr() / `item_detail.remove`.tr()
- **Bonus**: Shows translated ingredient name in the dialog

#### 3. Snackbar Messages
**Before**:
- "Deleting meal..." (hardcoded)
- "Meal deleted successfully" (hardcoded)  
- "Failed to delete meal" (hardcoded)

**After**:
- Uses `dashboard.deleting_meal`.tr()
- Uses `dashboard.meal_deleted_success`.tr()
- Uses `dashboard.meal_delete_failed`.tr()

#### 4. Swipe Action
**Before**:
- "Delete" in red swipe background (hardcoded)

**After**:
- Uses `dashboard.delete`.tr()
